# Merkle Tree

### Description of smart contract
This is Merkle Tree implementation on the Solidity language. You can pass any amount of transactions (actually you can pass any strings) in the smart contract constructor. Everyone can verify that some transaction is exist in this Merkle Tree using ```verify``` method. 

### Stack
The smart contract is written using Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. 
I used to [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) as a development environment framework.
